Question 1- Which family-friendly category was the most popular amongst customers? Which category was rented the least?

/* Query 1- Rental order counts of movies included in all the family-friendly categories. Family-friendly 
categories include 'Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy','Family' & 'Music' */

(For the data visualization, I only decided to show the rental counts for the film categories.
So, for that, the revised main query will be as follows)

Question 2- What are the rental order count distributions based on the categories and the rental duration quartiles?

based on their respective rental duration periods */

Question 3- What’s the difference in the monthly movie rental order counts based on the different store branches? What are the monthly 
average rental order counts?

Question 4- What was the monthly payment distribution for the top 5 spending customers in a particular year?

/* Query 4- Monthly spending amounts of the top 5 customers in a particular year */
